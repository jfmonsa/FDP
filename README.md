# About Racket programming language
* racket is a dialect of scheme programming language <- (racket is based in scheme that in turn is based in lisp)
* Is oritend towards the functional paradigm
* Its expressions are based on prefix notation or polish notation, n contrast to the more common infix notation
in which operators are placed between operands.

Ex 
prefix notation: `(== (+ 2 2))` vs infix notation: `2+2==4`

# Material
* How to design programs (book)
* [racket documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/)
